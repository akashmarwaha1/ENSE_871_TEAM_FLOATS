## Problem Definition

The current website is less engaging, the profile/project dashboard doesn’t exist and minimal search options.

## Project Background & Business Need/Opportunity Background

**RCE Saskatchewan has already created a web application that has the basic idea of the works and the projects they have. Combine the “Project & Profiles” section with “Saskatchewan Sustainability Programs”. Update the search options for the projects using our ideas. Make the website “The place” for the users to learn all about RCE in Saskatchewan.**
